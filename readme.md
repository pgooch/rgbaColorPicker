# rgbaColorPicker

### Usage
To install the rgbaColorPicker simple include rgbacolorpicker.min.js after you've included jQuery (version 1.4.3 or greater). The script will automatically convert any inputs with the class "<code>.rgbacolorpicker</code>" into color pickers. This class can be changed by modify the "<code>autorun</code>" variable inside the script file. You can disable autorun by setting "autorun" to a blank".

After installation you can manually run the colorpicker by calling the function "<code>.rgbacolorpicker()</code>". This will convert whatever you select into a color picker, regardless of if it in an input or not. *Note that if you choose to convert a non-input items your picker the color selection will not be savable.* Additionally when manually calling the colorpicker you can pass the options to it with a standard object. Currently only the following variable is recognized:

- stylesheet : false, 'path/to/stylesheet.css' - **default: false**
- callback : 'callback function' - **default: none**
- alpha : boolean  - **default: true**

For example to mimic the original version of this script you would manually call it like this:

<code>$(input.rgbapicker).rgbacolorpicker({stylesheet:'rbacolorpicker.css'});</code>

while mimicking the last version manually would simply be

<code>$(input.rgbapicker).rgbacolorpicker();</code>

Code is also up in on the jQuery plugins section here: <http://plugins.jquery.com/project/rgbaColorPicker>
